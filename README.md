# Work-Day-Planner
Daily planner built on JS with jQuery and Moment.js

Tasked with creating a simple application for handling work events and 'to-dos', 
the result lies before you, as polished as I can bear to make it.

Using the application is simple and intuitive, but here are a few things to note:

> The effects of save buttons and clear buttons will permanently change the local storage   
> Timeblocks that are in the past cannot be written in, so make sure before clearing anything that you aren't going to     
> lose important information.   
> Time is set by local machine.   

> That is pretty much it!


## User Story

> AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
> I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
> SO THAT I can manage my time effectively  

## Acceptance Criteria

> GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  
> WHEN I open the planner  
> THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  
> WHEN I scroll down  
> THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours  
> WHEN I view the time blocks for that day  
> THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  
> WHEN I click into a time block  
> THEN I can enter an event  
> WHEN I click the save button for that time block  
> THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  
> WHEN I refresh the page  
> THEN the saved events persist
