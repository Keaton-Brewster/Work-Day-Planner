# Work-Day-Planner
Daily planner built on JS with jQuery and Moment.js

Tasked with creating a simple application for handling work events and 'to-dos', 
the result lies before you, as polished as I can bear to make it.

Using the application is simple and intuitive, but here are a few things to note:
```
The effects of save buttons and clear buttons will permanently change the local storage   
Timeblocks that are in the past cannot be written in, so make sure before clearing anything that you aren't going to lose important information.   
Time is set by local machine.   

That is pretty much it!
```

## User Story

> AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
> I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
> SO THAT I can manage my time effectively  

## Acceptance Criteria

> GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  
> WHEN I open the planner  
> THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  
> WHEN I scroll down  
> THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours  
> WHEN I view the time blocks for that day  
> THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  
> WHEN I click into a time block  
> THEN I can enter an event  
> WHEN I click the save button for that time block  
> THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  
> WHEN I refresh the page  
> THEN the saved events persist
